# KD4Exo
Knowledge Distillation for Exoplanet Classification (KD4Exo)

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline for predicting the habitability of exoplanets using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques. Utilizing the NASA Exoplanet dataset, the primary goal is to create a robust habitability prediction model and explore knowledge distillation across multiple teacher models.
